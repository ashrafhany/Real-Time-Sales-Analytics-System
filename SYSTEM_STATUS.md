## ✅ SYSTEM STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

The real-time sales data management system is now **fully functional** with complete WebSocket broadcasting capabilities.

## 🚀 WHAT'S WORKING

### ✅ Core API Endpoints
- **POST /api/orders** - Creates orders and broadcasts real-time events ✅
- **GET /api/analytics** - Returns comprehensive sales analytics ✅
- **GET /api/test-broadcast** - Test endpoint for debugging broadcasts ✅

### ✅ Real-Time WebSocket Broadcasting - **FIXED AND WORKING**
- **Laravel Reverb WebSocket Server** running on port 8080 ✅
- **Automatic event broadcasting** on order creation ✅
- **Real-time analytics updates** after each order ✅
- **Multi-client support** with proper subscription management ✅
- **Frontend WebSocket connections** now working with native Pusher ✅

### ✅ Events Being Broadcast
1. **`new-order`** - Triggered when orders are created ✅
   - Complete order details including product information
   - Real-time timestamp
   
2. **`analytics-updated`** - Triggered after analytics recalculation ✅
   - Total revenue and order counts
   - Top-selling products
   - Recent activity metrics (last minute)

### ✅ Frontend Interfaces - **ALL WORKING**
- **api-tester.html** - Comprehensive API testing interface with WebSocket support ✅
- **websocket-test-final.html** - Dedicated WebSocket testing interface ✅
- **echo-debug.html** - WebSocket connection debugging tool ✅
- **Real-time notifications** and live data updates ✅

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Broadcasting Configuration ✅
```php
// .env
BROADCAST_DRIVER=reverb
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
